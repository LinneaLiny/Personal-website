  aboutIntro: [
    "My name is Xinyu Lin (林欣雨); I also go by Linnea. I'm a graduate student at the University of Michigan with a strong curiosity for learning and building things step by step. I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills in data analysis, problem solving, and continuous learning.",
    "When it comes to learning and work, I enjoy challenges and unfamiliar problems. I'm motivated by curiosity and find joy in gradual progress—turning complex problems into something understandable and solvable over time.",
    "Outside of work and study, I have a wide range of interests. I enjoy skiing and ice skating, and I'm very interested in trying surfing and scuba diving in the future; I plan to start by improving my swimming skills first. In my free time, I also like relaxing with my Nintendo Switch—feel free to add me as a friend!",
    "You're very welcome to explore my resume and projects. If my background or work resonates with you, feel free to reach out—I'm always open to new conversations and opportunities.",
